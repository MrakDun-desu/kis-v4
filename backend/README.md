# Kachna Information System version 4

This is a complex information system for product management created by bc. Marek Danƒço for the
school club Kachna at FIT BUT.

## Prerequisites for running locally

Dependencies: .NET 9, Docker

To setup the local database, installing necesary .NET tools is required. The tools are set up for
the workspace, so just run following to install them:

```bash
dotnet tool restore
```

This API doesn't provide authentication, it expects to be authenticated against a different service.
To emulate this, .NET provides a local tool to generate JWT tokens for testing. You can generate a
token by running:

```bash
dotnet user-jwts create -p App --role admin
```

Copy the output after the `Token: ` to pass it to the API for authentication.

## Running locally

To start the Docker container with the database, run:

```bash
docker-compose create database && docker-compose start database
```

After starting the database container, run the following command to migrate the database:

```bash
dotnet ef database update --project DAL.EF --startup-project App
```

After the database has successfully been migrated, the local program should function correctly. Run
the project with `dotnet run` and the API should be live at `localhost:5242`.
To test the API, go to `localhost:5242/scalar`.

To authenticate, in the Authentication section of the page, select "Bearer" as the Auth Type. Then
paste the generated user JWT into the "Token" field.
